# SimpleChat
A simple chat app I made in a week while learning networking. Couldn't figure out how to make the host public, so it's localhost only.

You might need to change the host address to run the code on your computer. Just run the server first and it will print its address; then go to Client constructor and you'll see where to type it in.
