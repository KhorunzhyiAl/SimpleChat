# SimpleChat
A simple chat app I made in a week while learning networking. Couldn't figure out how to make the host public, so it's localhost only.

You might need to change the host address on the client side to run the app on your computer. Just run the server first and it will print its address; then go to Users constructor and you'll see where to type it in.
